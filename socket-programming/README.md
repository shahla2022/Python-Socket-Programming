The concepts of socket programming in Python are explained in this repository.

A simple example is provided for communication between a server and a client using socket programming.

In the "socketprogramming.ipynb" file, I have provided examples and explanations related to socket programming. I highly recommend that you review this file to gain a better understanding of the concepts involved in socket programming.
